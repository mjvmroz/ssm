# ssm

`ssm` is a simple state machine library for Haskell.

It's designed to be simple and easy to use, but powerful enough to be useful in real-world applications.

It is very much a work in progress. The API is not stable, there are many features that are not yet implemented, and only a whisper of documentation and examples.
